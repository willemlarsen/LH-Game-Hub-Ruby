# Language Hunt Game Hub

This Ruby program is designed to allow a user to create and manage conversation games in their chosen language, according to the rules of the Language Hunt game: http://www.slideshare.net/willemlarsen/language-huntboardgame2014-sb

Also see http://languagehunters.org.

For each square on the game board (What, Who, Where, How Many, Which, When, Why, How), the LH Game Hub stores and retrieves the game script and audio file for the language in play, so game leaders don't have to remember (or even know!) the target language.

Thanks to Emmanuel Gaillot and Jay Bazuzi for pairing with me on this code.
